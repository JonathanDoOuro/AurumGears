# AurumGears
The size calculation and elaboration of manufacturing process sheets to manufacture gears can be developed manually, however, with the help of a computer this work can be
optimized, providing precision and speed. This undergraduate thesis has as its goal develop a website that is able to size calculate gears and make its 
manufacturing process sheets of turning and milling. For the development of the website it is used the programming language JavaScript, the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language. Based on the data of the gear's project, the website size calculate the gear and show to the user all the geometric features, and afterwards 
makes manufacturing process sheets containing parameters and the description of each process to get manufactured the gear that had been sized calculated.
